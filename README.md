**Course:**  IT Automation with Python.

**Part:** Using Python to Interact with the Operating System.

**Graded Assesment:** Qwiklabs Assessment: Log Analysis Using Regular Expressions.


**Assignment:**

Write a script to generate two different reports based on the ranking of errors generated by the system and the user usage statistics for the service.

Now, parse through each log entry in the syslog.log file by iterating over the file.

For each log entry, you'll have to first check if it matches the INFO or ERROR message formats. You should use regular expressions for this. When you get a successful match, add one to the corresponding value in the per_user dictionary. If you get an ERROR message, add one to the corresponding entry in the error dictionary by using proper data structure.

The error dictionary should be sorted by the number of errors from most common to least common.
The user dictionary should be sorted by username.
Insert column names as ("Error", "Count") at the zero index position of the sorted error dictionary. And insert column names as ("Username", "INFO", "ERROR") at the zero index position of the sorted per_user dictionary.

After sorting these dictionaries, store them in two different files: error_message.csv and user_statistics.csv.
